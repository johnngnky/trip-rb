Tripetto is a full-fledged form kit. Rapidly create and deploy smart flowing forms and surveys. Drop the kit in your codebase and use all of it, or just the parts you need. The visual [**editor**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tripetto) is for form creation, the [**collector**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tripetto-collector) for response collection and the [**SDK**](https://docs.tripetto.community/blocks) for developing more form building blocks.

This demo shows how to implement the collector for some basic form input controls using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). The goal is to show you how to implement the collector with minimal code footprint so you get a good understanding of the principles.

# How to run
1. [Download](https://gitlab.com/tripetto/examples/react/repository/master/archive.zip) or clone the [repository](https://gitlab.com/tripetto/examples/react) to your local machine:
```bash
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/tripetto/examples/react.git
```

2. Run `npm install` inside the downloaded/cloned folder:
```bash
$ npm install
```

3. Start the test server and open the URL `http://localhost:9000` in the browser of your choice to show the form:
```bash
$ npm test
```

4. Open another terminal/command prompt and start the editor (this will open an example definition file located at `./static/demo.json`):
```bash
$ npm start
```

This last command will probably automatically open your default browser with the URL http://localhost:3333. If not, open the browser of your choice and navigate to this URL.

When you have changed your form, click the `Save` button at the right top of the editor. Then, refresh the form collector to run the altered form.
